ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* AUTHORS
* CHANGES
* COPYING
* README
* README.forks
* README.recover
* graphics/
* graphics/bitcoin-symbol.svg
* graphics/ic_app_color_48dp.svg
* graphics/stat_notify_received.svg
* pom.xml
* proguard.cfg
* test/
* test/de/
* test/de/schildbach/
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/Base43Test.java
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/BluetoothTest.java
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/CryptoTest.java
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/FormatsTest.java
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/bitcoin-wallet-backup-testnet-3.50
* test/de/schildbach/wallet/util/bitcoin-wallet-backup-testnet-3.50-crlf
* wallet.iml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
